      <h3>Bare Metal STM32</h3>
      <p>
        A while back I had to develop a high speed monitoring system. After some
        research I decided to use a ARM STM32 MPU. The STM32 developers wrote 2
        libraries: HAL & LL. HAL is easy to use because the programmer just
        needs to learn the so called high level API commands. LL on the other
        hand is a bit more difficult to use. This is due the fact that it uses a
        lot less functions. I decided to use HAL because I had zero experience
        with STM32 boards. After some coding the application worked but I did
        not understand what was going on. HAL works fine and quick but if a
        error or bug occures it is very difficult to solve it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckly I learned some register programming in C for the MSP430FR5969.
        This is a Cortex M0 board, a lot easier to use than my STM32MP1 MPU,
        which contains a Cortex M4 and Cortex A7. The Code Composer Studio IDE
        offers the user a easy to use minimal coding environment for my MSP430.
        Keil IDE, the STM32 variant does not, the user needs to pay for a
        licence to write a program that is larger than 30kB. Other variants like
        System Workbench or STM32Cube IDE are bloated just like Keil and they
        are not easy to use if you want a minimal environment. After some
        digging I realised that the CMSIS and ST devs offer files for every
        STM32 board, these contain references to the memory locations of the
        chip. Combined with a Makefile, Text editor and debugger this would be
        the best experience possible (at least in my opinion of course).
      </p>

      <p>
        My project is open source and free to use, it contains easy to use
        templates for the STM32 L476RG microcontroller. It works on Windows, OSX
        and GNU/Linux. Feel free to commit some code or to contact me if you
        have any questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future I will try to write some code for some other cortex chips.
        Also I'm trying to create a simular project for the MSP430 board so I
        can ditch the Code Composer Studio IDE.
